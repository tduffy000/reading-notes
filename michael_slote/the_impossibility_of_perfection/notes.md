# __The Impossibility of Perfection__
November 2021

## Summary
Slote argues for a Virtue ethics using a feminist perspective and strike down Aristotle's notion that all virtues are required (perfection, or his unity thesis) for a person to be virtuous. He setups a tension between competing virtues, what he calls __partial virtues__ or __partial values__, with the example of a situation calling for both tactfulness and honesty. In his view, in such a situation, one cannot act **perfectly** virtuous, and thus this calls into question Aristotle's project of unity with respect to virtues (p. 31). 

This dynamic then gets expanded (or rather clarified) as being derivable from a feminist perspective by acknowledging that many values and virutes have, historically, been ascribed to a particular gender. The example of adventurousness v. security is used, amongst others. Slote argues that the perfection of virtue is an artifact of the patriarchical focus on justice and autonomous virtues, and lacks a balance with communal virtues. 

He aims to extend Isaiah Berlin's thesis that perfection is impossible, as referenced by pointing out he posited that a perfect society both equal and just in equal measure was unachievable, to virtue ethics. Aristotleans require much of an ethical actor. They must hold the __correct__ virtue in their hearts while acting. For Slote, this requirement misaligns with the realities of life, which is far messier. He also cites the patriarchy as having contributed to this by attributing virtues of justice as the central framework for acting ethical, at the potential cost of emotional frameworks (hence the focus on care ethics).

## Concepts
#### Partial Values
These are described throughout as "warring" and in tension with one another. It seems persuasive to a modern audience that acting __virtuous__ in any given situation is incredibly complex. Is it right to focus on your career? Perhaps because it provides security for your loved ones, enhances the world (assuming your profession's contributions are positive), etc. But that comes with an opportunity cost (my words not his), in a potential omission of familial and communal emotional connections.

## Reactions
> Care ethics in its most ambitious form seeks to offer accounts of "masculine" concepts like justice and autonomy in terms of the "feminine" ideals of caring about and personal connection with others. (p.4)

This comes up a lot in the book. A tension between traditionally masculine and feminine values. I'm not sure I understand where _he_ has derived the difference from. However, one could posit that the traditional roles of hunter and gatherer (not to mention mother) have something to do with it. Those roles (likely formed before we even "settled" and formed communities) have been ensconced in literature and myth for millenia. I'm not sure Slote successfully points this out though. 

> But men in o have to face such a choice. If they go completely with their careers, they miss out on some deep affiliative values. They end up as "distant fathers" and "part-time husbands", and even if such men aren't capable of recognizing the grave loss that that entails in and for their lives, many women can. (p.33)

This might have been more true in the 1950s. Now, women are getting more college degrees than men in the US. I guess our assumption is that women are somehow more _aware_ of the loss when they chose their careers over their families? Either way, it's a small tragedy. I think a more important point is that an ignorance of these goods as being _partial_ leads down a dark path. I'm tempted to call it an addiction if an individual is so **unbalanced**, but I'm not sure that's _quite_ right. It certainly doesn't feel like the path to a virtuous life though.

> So I think the more superficial or "accidental" talk of career vs. family points us toward the more general or generalized choice between creative fulfillment/accomplishment and deep relationships... (p.71)

Isn't this just the eternal tension between assimilation and individuation? Do we ever really resolve that? It's probably unresolvable no? I mean it starts well into infancy with a baby. It's a central theme of being a teenager. A formulation of an identity has this weird mixture of adopting things from _others_ but being used to define the **Self** as unique. Cormac McCarthy complained that books must be made up of other books. Realistically, our identities are just composites of things we have experienced over time. There's no "originality". I think there's also a muddling here of what "creative" fulfillment means. Solitary pursuits like writing and painting perhaps are applicable. But what of theatre? Performance art? And, perhaps, the most central creation in our history: having a child.  

> Substantial pain may be necessary to the best __possible__ life, but since it also arguably mars that life's happiness, the life, whatever else may happen in it, cannot be perfect with respect to happiness. (p.85)

Yes, clearly this calls into question the definition of perfection quite well. Can something be on aggregate perfect even if its constiuent parts might not be perfect. The answer certainly feels like we're describing "good enough" more than "perfect".

> For the care ethicist, serious potential human damage can trump or outweigh rights of autonomy--that is precisely what it means to treat connection with others as more important, ethically, than our separateness from or autonomy rights against others. (p.97)

This sentence is kind of a throw away in the book, but incredibly relevant to where we find ourselves as a nation at present. Each side seems to ignore the fact (at least as the popular media would have you believe) that liberty is composed of two rights: freedom _from_ and freedom _to_. Of course, this tension didn't start four years ago. Certainly, we can look all the way back to Locke and the social contract to witness the eternal battle. What do we sacrifice as liberties? And why? Is it solely for security? That is, likely, the more masculine--Conservative--perspective. But do we not also sacrifice autonomous desires/preferences/needs for the good of our _community_. And what that looks like __certainly__ depends on what you define your _community_ as. Is there progress to be made there? Or, at the very least, compromise?
